# Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

This is a system which enables farmers to monitor and control their farms with a web-based application built with Node-RED. It uses IBM IoT Watson cloud platform as its backend.

## Description

  * Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
  
  * The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
  
  * Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
  
  * Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
  
  * Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
  
  * Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.

## Simulator

The data of the farm like soil moisture,humidity and temperature are collected from sensors and then need to be sent to cloud
but here I am using a simulator in which we are going to connect it to the IBM cloud account and send data to cloud
