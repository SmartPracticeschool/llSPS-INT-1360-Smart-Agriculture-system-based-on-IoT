# Smart Agriculture system based on IoT

This is a system which enables farmers to monitor and control their farms with a web-based application built with Node-RED. It uses IBM IoT Watson cloud platform as its backend.

## Description

>Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
  
  >The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
  
  >Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
  
  >Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
  
  >Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
  
  >Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
